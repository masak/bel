=head1 NAME

Language::Bel::Tutorial - Bel language tutorial

=head1 VERSION

version 0.35

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This part is not written yet, but the plan is (as explained in #143) to base
this off the Arc tutorial, which is written for people with no prior Lisp
experience. It should be possible to adapt it to Bel and still have it feel
natural and comprehensive.

There doesn't have to be only one tutorial â€” we could have more of them, beyond
the main one.
